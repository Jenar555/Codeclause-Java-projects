# Folder_Locker
Folder Locker Software Using Java
Project Description: This application is developed using Java-17 version. There we have used standard libraries such as AWT, IO and SWING. This software is designed to provide an extra layer of security to important files and folders in a computer. When I lock any folder for security purpose, I have to enter a valid password and confirm it. If both of fields do not match, an error message will show and highlight with red mark. When I try to open this folder, the folder will show empty. This software also includes a system tray icon that appears at the right-bottom side when the software is running. During unlock, when I enter the valid passcode, I will be directed inside the folder. There has also an option of remove password. Giving old valid passcode, I will be able to remove passcode successfully.
